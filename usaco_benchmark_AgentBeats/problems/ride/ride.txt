USACO 1993-1994: Ride the Comet

You are tracking the orbit of Comet Halley.  Each comet and each group of
astronauts is assigned a name consisting solely of uppercase letters A–Z.  To
decide whether a given group should launch to meet a given comet, compute for
each name the product of its letters’ positions in the alphabet (A = 1, B = 2,
…, Z = 26).  Reduce each product modulo 47.  If the two remainders match, the
group should go meet the comet; otherwise they should stay home.

Input
-----
Two lines: the comet name followed by the group name.  Each line is 1–6
uppercase letters.

Output
------
Print `GO` if the remainders match, otherwise print `STAY`, each followed by a
newline.
