USACO 1994-1995: Greedy Gift Givers

Around the holidays a group of friends exchange gifts.  Each participant starts
with zero dollars.  When it is someone’s turn, that person specifies how much
money to spend and how many friends will receive gifts.  The spender splits the
money evenly (integer division) among the recipients; any leftover dollars stay
with the spender.  Gifts can only be given to people inside the group.

Input
-----
Line 1: integer `N` (2 ≤ N ≤ 10), the number of people.
Lines 2..N+1: the names of the participants (unique strings without spaces).
The remainder of the file repeats the following data for each gift-giving
action in the same order as the participant list:
* A line with the giver’s name.
* A line with two integers `amount` and `num_receivers`.
* `num_receivers` lines, each with the name of a recipient.

Output
------
For every participant, in the original order, print a line `name balance`
showing their net gain (which may be negative) after all gift exchanges.
