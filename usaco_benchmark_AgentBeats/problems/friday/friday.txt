USACO 1993-1994: Friday the Thirteenth

Given an integer `N`, consider the years 1900 through 1900+N−1 inclusive.  Track
the day of the week for every 13th of the month in that time span (where Jan 1,
1900 is a Monday).  Count how many times the 13th falls on Saturday, Sunday,
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—in that exact order.

Input
-----
Single line with integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 400).

Output
------
One line containing seven integers separated by spaces, corresponding to the
counts for Saturday through Friday.
